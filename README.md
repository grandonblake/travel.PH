knowledge about the Philippines by presenting a good and comprehensive amount of information regarding 
the country’s culture, history, landmarks, and the like, all with just a tap on the screen. The application 
mostly wants to promote the culture and tourism within the country. With the help of an application that is 
like a pocket tour guide, we want to reach the peak of tourism in the Philippines. Our application offers 
security and liability, with features such as being able to recommend the best places to tour, and being able 
to interact with users inside the app. Also, the programmers made sure that they will be able to offer a 
smooth and user-friendly application to the users. To summarize, the application wants to promote our
